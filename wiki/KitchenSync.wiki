== What ==
KitchenSync is a utility for periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities.

The code is stable but primitive.

== Why == 

This program was written for two reasons. Firstly, UIQ mysteriously lacks the ability to periodically trigger synchronization of data. Secondly, I needed a project to learn Symbian programming.

== How to obtain ==

The complete source code is found in the subversion repository.

An unsigned compiled version of KitchenSync is available for download [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/KitchenSync/tags/alpha1/group/KitchenSync_unsigned.sis here]. Note that this is unusable without signing it yourself. See "Issues" below.

== Issues ==

Symbian 9/UIQ 3 requires programs that make use of more than basic functionality to be signed before they can be installed on a device. KitchenSync makes use of the following capabilities of Symbian that require signing:

  * LocalServices 
  * NetworkServices 
  * ReadDeviceData
  * ReadUserData

Right now the only way to make KitchenSync work on your device is to get your own developer certificate, and sign it for your very phone. Hopefully I will find a way around this.
