= Podcast Player =

The Podcast Player aims to be a fully featured podcatcher for UIQ. It is still under development, but the latest alpha version is very usable.

The intention is to release one alpha version every week, and hopefully beta and release versions in December.

Some ideas
  * Tedesco (means German in Italian, and TDesC is a string in Symbian)
  * Some kind of play on casting (injection molding, CNC, forging)
  * Solid
  * Ingot
  * Foundry (in which you produce casts)
  * Mint
  * Repo Podcatcher
  * Hyland
  * Alembic
