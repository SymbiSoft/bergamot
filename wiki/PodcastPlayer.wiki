= Podcast Player =

The Podcast Player is a fully functional podcatcher for UIQ. It is still in early development, but there is working [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk code] in Subversion, as well as the latest "trunk" [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk/group/Podcast_udeb_signed.sis debug build]. For more stable versions, see Releases below.

The intention is to release one alpha version every week. I intend to have a fully functional beta version by christmas at the latest.

*WARNING! Downloading large files  such as podcasts over mobile phone networks can be extremely expensive. Please make sure you have a flat rate data plan or use a wireless LAN before you use this program!*

  # Install on your phone
  # Run the program
  # Choose Subscriptions
  # Choose one of the pre-configured subscriptions, the feed is downloaded and parsed
  # Download an episode by selecting it (WARNING! the download can't be stopped, and may be very large)
  # When the Download is complete, go back to the main menu
  # Choose Episodes
  # Select a file to play it
  # Select again to pause and again to resume
  # Add your own feeds by editing d:\podcasts\feeds.cfg, the syntax is "title|URL" without the quotes.

= Name =

Podcast Player is just a placeholder name. [http://groups.google.com/group/bergamot Come up with something better!]

Some ideas
  * Tedesco (means German in Italian, and TDesC is a string in Symbian)
  * Some kind of play on casting (injection molding, CNC, forging)
  * Solid
  * Ingot
  * Foundry (in which you produce casts)
  * Mint
