= Podcast Player =

The Podcast Player aims to be a fully featured podcatcher for UIQ. It is still in early development, but there is working [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk code] in Subversion, as well as the latest "trunk" [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk/group/Podcast_udeb_signed.sis debug build]. For more stable versions, see Releases below.

The intention is to release one alpha version every week, and hopefully a beta in December.

= The UIQ Open Contest =

I stumbled upon the [http://uiqopen.uiq.com/ UIQ Open] contest. Hopefully the podcast player will be good enough to submit before December 31st.

= Planning =

This is how I plan to implement features. Please [http://groups.google.com/group/bergamot help me find out what's important!]

  * Alpha 3 (November 25th)
    * Proper feed handling, i.e. know what's new
    * New podcast notification
    * Automatic background downloading
    * Check connection type, option to download only on WLAN
    * ID3 parsing if necessary
    * Volume control
    * Support for other feeds (Atom, RSS 0.9, any more?)

  * Alpha 4
    * Video support

= Name =

Podcast Player is just a placeholder name. [http://groups.google.com/group/bergamot Come up with something better!]

Some ideas
  * Tedesco (means German in Italian, and TDesC is a string in Symbian)
  * Some kind of play on casting (injection molding, CNC, forging)
  * Solid
  * Ingot
  * Foundry (in which you produce casts)
  * Mint
