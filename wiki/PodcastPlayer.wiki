= Podcast Player Project =

The aim of this project is to create pretty much a UIQ clone of [http://www.blogs.s60.com/nokiapodcasting/ Nokia Podcasting]. This project has just started, and the code is based on the Sync project. There is [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk some code] in Subversion, however it is not yet very useful. It can play audio files, and contains semi-working download code.

The first usable version will be alpha 1, which will be available in the near future! I intend to have a pretty functional beta version by christmas.

Oh, and Podcast Player Project is just a placeholder name. Come up with something better!

= Release Plan =

  * Alpha 1 (sometime in November)
    * Plays files from memory
    * Stores position in audio file
    * Rudimentary UI

  * Alpha 2 (also November)
    * Downloads file from URL

  * Alpha 3 
    * RSS parsing, automated downloads

  * Alpha 4
    * Check connection type, option to download only on WLAN

= Feature Ideas =

  * Download RSS in the background
  * Download MP3/whatever format
  * Manual/automatic download
  * Automatic check if on WLAN or 3G, option to download only on WLAN
  * Notify the user of a new podcast
  * Keep track of position inside audio file, even between restarts, and for multiple podcasts at a time

= Help! =

Please help me out with the podcast project! If you don't think you can help, I think you're wrong. Most people can do at least one of the below:

  * Feedback
  * Feature ideas
  * Graphics, icons etc. (please!)
  * UI design
  * Coding
