= Podcast Player Project =

The aim of this project is to create pretty much a UIQ clone of [http://www.blogs.s60.com/nokiapodcasting/ Nokia Podcasting]. This project has just started, and the code is based on the Sync project. There is [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk code] in Subversion, as well as the latest [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk debug build].

The first usable version will be alpha 1, which I intend to release this Sunday! From then on one tagged version will be release each week. I intend to have a pretty functional beta version by christmas.

Oh, and Podcast Player Project is just a placeholder name. Come up with something better!
