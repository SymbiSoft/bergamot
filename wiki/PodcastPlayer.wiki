= Podcast Player =

The Podcast Player aims to be a fully featured podcatcher for UIQ. It is still under development, but the latest alpha version is very usable.

The intention is to release one alpha version every week, and hopefully a beta in December.

= Name =

Podcast Player is just a placeholder name. [http://groups.google.com/group/bergamot Come up with something better!]

Some ideas
  * Tedesco (means German in Italian, and TDesC is a string in Symbian)
  * Some kind of play on casting (injection molding, CNC, forging)
  * Solid
  * Ingot
  * Foundry (in which you produce casts)
  * Mint
  * Repo Pod
  * Hyland
