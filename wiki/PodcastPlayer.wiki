= Podcast Player =

The aim of this project is to create a fully functional podcatcher, in the spirit of for instance [http://www.blogs.s60.com/nokiapodcasting/ Nokia Podcasting]. There is working [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk code] in Subversion, as well as the latest [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk/group/Podcast_udeb_signed.sis debug build].

The intention is to release one alpha version every week. I intend to have a fully functional beta version by christmas at the latest.

= Releases = 

  * Alpha 1 (November 11th) |  [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/tags/alpha1 code] | [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/tags/alpha1/group/Podcast_udeb_signed.sis SIS]
    * Plays MP3 and AAC from memory card (must be in D:\podcasts)
    * Fetches and parses RSS 2.0 feeds
    * Feeds are defined in the plain text D:\podcasts\feeds.cfg
    * Downloads audio files from feeds
    * Rudimentary UI

= How to use =

  # Install on your phone
  # Run the program
  # Choose Subscriptions
  # Choose one of the pre-configured subscriptions, the feed is downloaded and parsed
  # Download an episode by selecting it (WARNING! the download can't be stopped, and may be very large)
  # When the Download is complete, go back to the main menu
  # Choose Episodes
  # Select a file to play it
  # Select again to pause and again to resume
  # Add your own feeds by editing d:\podcasts\feeds.cfg, the syntax is "title|URL" without the quotes.

Some ideas
  * Tedesco (means German in Italian, and TDesC is a string in Symbian)
