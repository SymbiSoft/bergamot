= Podcast Player =

There seems to be interest in a good podcasting client for UIQ 3. The built-in media player does not cut it for serious podcast use.

This project has just started, and there is no code as of today, however the basic structure  fr√•n KitchenSync is suitable as a starting point.

Oh, and Podcast Player is just a placeholder name. Come up with something better!
