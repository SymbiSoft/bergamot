= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers such as Google Calendar through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync], [http://www.mobical.net Mobical] and [http://zyb.com Zyb]. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something UIQ mysteriously lacks! You can set it to sync your data every 5 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours or every 24 hours.

== How To Get ==

You can download the SIS file from Releases below, however Swim makes use of Symbian features that require signing. As I have not deemed it good enough to send for signing yet, you basically have these two options:

  * Get a developer certificate from symbiansigned.com and sign it yourself in a complicated manner.
  * Wait until I have it signed for everybody to enjoy, which I will do soon!

== Usage ==

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts in your agenda manager
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

== Feature Ideas ==

I've been thinking about turning Swim into a generic maintenance tool for UIQ. Features that could be added are for instance

  * [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/117211 SNTP] support

== Releases ==

The complete source code is found in the [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk subversion repository]. Compiled binaries for each release can be found on our [http://code.google.com/p/bergamot/downloads/list Downloads page]. Note that the unsigned binaries are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

  * 0.20 (2008-02-25) [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/tags/beta2 Source]
    * Autostart now works on newer firmware

  * Beta2 (2007-11-04)
    * Client loads list of sync accounts every time it's shown
    * KitchenSync is now Swim, and KitchenSync.exe is SyncClient.exe, while KitchenSyncServer.exe is SyncServer.exe
    * Note! Since the executable name has changed since last version, while the app ID remains, KitchenSync must be uninstalled before this version can be installed
