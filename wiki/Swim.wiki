= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data with internet servers such as Google Calendar (through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync]), [http://www.mobical.net Mobical], [http://zyb.com Zyb], [http://www.scheduleworld.com ScheduleWorld], [http://ovi.com/ Ovi] or any system running [http://www.funambol.com Funambol]. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something both UIQ and S60 mysteriously lack! You can set it to sync your data every 15 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours, every 12 hours, daily, or weekly.

Swim is available for both UIQ and S60 3rd ed. _however S60 3.2 (FP2) is not yet supported (N78, N79, N96, 6220)!_

== How To Install ==

To use Swim, you need to do three things:

  # Download the latest unsigned Swim SIS file from our [http://code.google.com/p/bergamot/downloads/list download page].
  # Sign Swim using Symbian [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online]. 
    * Get your IMEI by typing `*#06#` on your phone
    * Select the following capabilities: `LocalServices NetworkServices WriteDeviceData ReadDeviceData ReadUserData WriteUserData ProtServ`, or simply select all.
  # Install the signed SIS file on your phone.

*Note that there have been reports about "maintenance breaks" causing Symbian signed to report that the file may have been "flagged as a potential virus by our scanning or because the format of your sis file is incorrect or corrupt." [http://developer.symbian.com/forum/thread.jspa?threadID=27993&tstart=0 This is a Symbian Signed error] and submitting it at a later point will work just fine.*

== How to Use ==

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts:
    * UIQ: Go to Agenda manager (the calendar app)
    * S60: Settings/Connections/Sync, Tools/Sync or Connections/Sync
    * Tip: In the SyncML settings you can choose which internet account to use, so the system won't ask you every time the sync is triggered by Swim
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Swim now automatically starts with the phone, and runs invisibly in the background (The process is SyncServer, the UI does not need to run)
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

The sync timer is set relative to the time of day when you enable it. So if you enable hourly sync at 12:03, it will sync at 13:03, 14:03 etc. Similarly, if you set it for daily sync, it will sync at 12:03 every day. This part could certainly be improved :)

== Releases ==
