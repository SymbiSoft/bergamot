= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data with internet servers such as Google Calendar (through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync]), [http://www.mobical.net Mobical], [http://zyb.com Zyb] and [http://ovi.com/ Ovi]. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something both UIQ and S60 mysteriously lack! You can set it to sync your data every 15 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours, every 12 hours, daily, or weekly.

_Swim is now available for both UIQ and S60!_
