== ~~KitchenSync~~ Swim == 

KitchenSync is now named Swim!

It has come to my attention that the fine folks at KDE have named one of their programs KitchenSync as well. As it is in none of our interests to create confusion, I am changing the name of KitchenSync. I think the new name will be Swim, as in "Sync or Swim".

== What ==
Swim is a utility for periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities.

The code tagged as "beta1" in subversion is stable and works well. I run it constantly on my Sony Ericsson P1i.

== Why == 

This program was written for two reasons. Firstly, UIQ mysteriously lacks the ability to periodically trigger synchronization of data. Secondly, I needed a project to learn Symbian programming.

== Releases ==
The complete source code is found in the subversion repository. Compiled binaries for each release exists as well. Note that these are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

== Issues ==

Symbian 9/UIQ 3 requires programs that make use of more than basic functionality to be signed before they can be installed on a device. Swim makes use of the following capabilities of Symbian that require signing:

  * LocalServices 
  * NetworkServices 
  * ReadDeviceData
  * ReadUserData

Right now the only way to make Swim work on your device is to get your own developer certificate, and sign it for your very phone.
