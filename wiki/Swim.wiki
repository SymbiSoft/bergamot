= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data with internet servers such as Google Calendar (through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync]), [http://www.mobical.net Mobical], [http://zyb.com Zyb] and [http://ovi.com/ Ovi]. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something UIQ mysteriously lacks! You can set it to sync your data every 5 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours or every 24 hours.

At the moment Swim exists for UIQ3. An S60 version of Swim will be released sometime in the future.
