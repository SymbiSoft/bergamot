== Swim == 

KitchenSync is now named Swim, as the former name happened to clash with a similar program for KDE. Why Swim? you say, well as I see it you can either Sync, or Swim!

== What ==
Swim is a utility for periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities.

The latest code in [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk Subversion] is stable and works well. I run it constantly on my Sony Ericsson P1i.

== Why == 

This program was written for two reasons. Firstly, UIQ mysteriously lacks the ability to periodically trigger synchronization of data. Secondly, I needed a project to learn Symbian programming.

== Releases ==
The complete source code is found in the subversion repository. Compiled binaries for each release exists as well. Note that these are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

  * Beta2 (2007-11-04)
    * Client loads list of sync accounts every time it's shown
    * KitchenSync is now Swim, and KitchenSync.exe is SyncClient.exe, while KitchenSyncServer.exe is SyncServer.exe
    * Note! Since the executable name has changed since last version, while the app ID remains, KitchenSync must be uninstalled before this version can be installed

== Issues ==

Symbian 9/UIQ 3 requires programs that make use of more than basic functionality to be signed before they can be installed on a device. Swim makes use of the following capabilities of Symbian that require signing:

  * LocalServices 
  * NetworkServices 
  * ReadDeviceData
  * ReadUserData

Right now the only way to make Swim work on your device is to get your own developer certificate, and sign it for your very phone.
