== Swim == 

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities. You can set it to sync your data every 5 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours or every 24 hours.

The latest code in [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk Subversion] is stable and works well. I run it constantly on my Sony Ericsson P1i in order to sync my calendar with Google Calendar, through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync], and my contacts with [http://www.mobical.net Mobical].

== Why == 

This program was written for two reasons. Firstly, UIQ mysteriously lacks the ability to periodically trigger synchronization of data. Secondly, I needed a project to learn Symbian programming.

== Usage ==

Note! Before the new Symbian Open Signed option is available (which should be any day now!) you need a developer certificate to use Swim.

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts in your agenda manager
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

== Releases ==
The complete source code is found in the subversion repository. Compiled binaries for each release exists as well. Note that these are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

  * Beta2 (2007-11-04)
    * Client loads list of sync accounts every time it's shown
    * KitchenSync is now Swim, and KitchenSync.exe is SyncClient.exe, while KitchenSyncServer.exe is SyncServer.exe
    * Note! Since the executable name has changed since last version, while the app ID remains, KitchenSync must be uninstalled before this version can be installed

== Issues ==

Symbian 9/UIQ 3 requires programs that make use of more than basic functionality to be signed before they can be installed on a device. Swim makes use of the following capabilities of Symbian that require signing:

  * LocalServices 
  * NetworkServices 
  * ReadDeviceData
  * ReadUserData

Right now the only way to make Swim work on your device is to get your own developer certificate, and sign it for your very phone.
