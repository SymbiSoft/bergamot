= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data with internet servers such as Google Calendar (through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync]), [http://www.mobical.net Mobical], [http://zyb.com Zyb] and [http://ovi.com/ Ovi]. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something both UIQ and S60 mysteriously lack! You can set it to sync your data every 15 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours, every 12 hours, daily, or weekly.

_Swim is now available for both UIQ and S60!_

== How To Install ==

To use Swim, you need to do three things:

  # Download the latest unsigned Swim SIS file from our [http://code.google.com/p/bergamot/downloads/list download page].
  # Sign Swim using Symbian [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online]. 
    * Get your IMEI by typing `*#06#` on your phone
    * Select the following capabilities: `LocalServices NetworkServices WriteDeviceData ReadDeviceData ReadUserData WriteUserData ProtServ`, or simply select all.
  # Install the signed SIS file on your phone.

*Note that there have been reports about "maintenance breaks" causing Symbian signed to report that the file may have been "flagged as a potential virus by our scanning or because the format of your sis file is incorrect or corrupt." [http://developer.symbian.com/forum/thread.jspa?threadID=27993&tstart=0 This is a Symbian Signed error] and submitting it at a later point will work just fine.*

== How to Use ==

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts in your agenda manager (UIQ)/sync settings (S60)
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Swim now automatically starts with the phone, and runs invisibly in the background
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

The sync timer is set relative to the time of day when you enable it. So if you enable hourly sync at 12:03, it will sync at 13:03, 14:03 etc. Similarly, if you set it for daily sync, it will sync at 12:03 every day. This part could certainly be improved :)

== Releases ==

The complete source code is found in the [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk subversion repository]. Compiled binaries for each release can be found on our [http://code.google.com/p/bergamot/downloads/list Downloads page]. Note that the unsigned binaries are unusable without signing them yourself!
