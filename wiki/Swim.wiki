= Swim =

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something UIQ mysteriously lacks! You can set it to sync your data every 5 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours or every 24 hours.

The latest code in [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk Subversion] is stable and works well. I run it constantly on my Sony Ericsson P1i in order to sync my calendar with Google Calendar, through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync], and my contacts with [http://www.mobical.net Mobical].

== How To Get ==

Swim makes use of Symbian features that require signing (ReadDeviceData specifically). As I have not deemed it good enough to send for signing yet, you have a few options:

  * Wait until the Symbian Open Signed method becomes avialable (it says Q4 on the website) and sign it yourself in a simple manner.
  * Get a developer certificate from symbiansigned.com and sign it yourself in a complicated manner.
  * Send me your IMEI number (which you get by pressing {{{*#06}}} on your handset) in an email to teknolog (at) gmail (dot) com, and I will sign it for you.
  * Wait until I have it signed for everybody to enjoy.

== Usage ==

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts in your agenda manager
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

== Feature Ideas ==

I've been thinking about turning Swim into a generic maintenance tool for UIQ. Features that could be added are for instance

  * NTP support

== Releases ==

The complete source code is found in the subversion repository. Compiled binaries for each release exists as well. Note that these are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

  * Beta2 (2007-11-04)
    * Client loads list of sync accounts every time it's shown
    * KitchenSync is now Swim, and KitchenSync.exe is SyncClient.exe, while KitchenSyncServer.exe is SyncServer.exe
    * Note! Since the executable name has changed since last version, while the app ID remains, KitchenSync must be uninstalled before this version can be installed
