== Swim == 

Swim is a utility for automatic periodic synchronization of data in UIQ3 with internet servers. It makes use of the existing SyncML support in the system, and adds timing capabilities, something UIQ mysteriously lacks! You can set it to sync your data every 5 minutes, every hour, every 4 hours or every 24 hours.

The latest code in [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Sync/trunk Subversion] is stable and works well. I run it constantly on my Sony Ericsson P1i in order to sync my calendar with Google Calendar, through [http://www.goosync.com/ GooSync], and my contacts with [http://www.mobical.net Mobical].

== How To Get Swim ==

Note! This program makes use of Symbian features that REQUIRE signing. Before the new Symbian Open Signed option is available (which should be any day now!) you need to sign Swim using a developer certificate. If you don't know how to do this, I can sign it for your very phone if you send me your IMEI number in an email.

If you do have your own developer certificate, or if the open signed option has finally become available, you can get the unsigned version below and sign it yourself.

Once I am convinced it works fine, and that there is at least some demand for this, I will submit it for free software signing.

== Usage ==

  # Set up one or more SyncML accounts in your agenda manager
  # Run Swim, and set up a timer
  # Enjoy your synchronized data!

== Feature Ideas ==

I've been thinking about turning Swim into a generic maintenance tool for UIQ. Features that could be added are for instance

  * NTP support

== Releases ==

The complete source code is found in the subversion repository. Compiled binaries for each release exists as well. Note that these are unusable without signing them yourself. See "Issues" below.

    * Client loads list of sync accounts every time it's shown
    * KitchenSync is now Swim, and KitchenSync.exe is SyncClient.exe, while KitchenSyncServer.exe is SyncServer.exe
    * Note! Since the executable name has changed since last version, while the app ID remains, KitchenSync must be uninstalled before this version can be installed
