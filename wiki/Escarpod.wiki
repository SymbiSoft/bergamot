== Credits ==

Escarpod was started by Sebastian Brännström, a.k.a _Teknolog_. Much help was received from Lars Persson, a.k.a. _AnotherGuest,_ who did most of the UI as well as general code improvement. Alan Eddie drew all icons.

== Data Usage Warning == 

Before you start using Escarpod, check your data rates with your access provider. Many charge exorbitant fees, and downloading large files such as podcasts may force you to sell your house to pay the bills. We're not kidding!

Many providers offer flat rate fees that allow you unlimited data for a more reasonable charge.

If your phone supports it, using your own wireless LAN is a great option. Escarpod allows you to specify a connection.

We need help translating Escarpod into more languages. If you want to translate it into your language, it is quite simple! Download the English [http://bergamot.googlecode.com/svn/Podcast/trunk/group/PodcastClient_english.rls language file], open it in a text editor such as Emacs or Notepad, and translate all the strings. Then send them to us in an email to bergamot@googlegroups.com.

== Supported Phones ==

All UIQ 3 based phones should work, however Escarpod has been specifically tested on the following phones.

== Why Escarpod? ==

The name Escarpod is a pun on the french Escargot, meaning snail, and also used for cooked snails is many other languages. Apart from being a cutesy name allowing the nice little icon, downloading podcasts over cell phone networks is at best done at snail's pace.
