Escarpod was started by Sebastian Brännström who wrote the feed parser, the file downloader and the player. Much help was received from Lars Persson, who did most of the UI as well as code improvement. Alan Eddie drew all the graphics, including icons.

Before you start using Escarpod, check your data rates with your access provider. Many charge exorbitant fees, and downloading large files such as podcasts may force you to sell your house.

Many provides offer flat rate fees that allow you unlimited data for a more reasonable charge.

If your phone supports it, using your own wireless LAN is a great option. Escarpod allows you to specify a connection.
