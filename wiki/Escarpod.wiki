== Credits ==

Escarpod was started by Sebastian Brännström, a.k.a _Teknolog_. Much help was received from Lars Persson, a.k.a. _AnotherGuest,_ who did most of the UI as well as general code improvement. Alan Eddie drew all icons.

== Data Usage Warning == 

Before you start using Escarpod, check your data rates with your access provider. Many charge exorbitant fees, and downloading large files such as podcasts may force you to sell your house to pay the bills. We're not kidding!

Many providers offer flat rate fees that allow you unlimited data for a more reasonable charge.

If your phone supports it, using your own wireless LAN is a great option. Escarpod allows you to specify a connection.

== Why Escarpod? ==

The name Escarpod is a pun on the french Escargot, meaning snail, and also used for cooked snails is many other languages. Apart from being a cutesy name allowing the nice little icon, downloading podcasts over cell phone networks is at best done at snail's pace.
