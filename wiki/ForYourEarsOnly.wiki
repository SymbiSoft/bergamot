#summary Only for you.

= For Your Ears Only =

For Your Ears Only is a Symbian app that automatically pauses the Symbian music player when the headset is disconnected.

It is based on how Android works, and also [https://garage.maemo.org/projects/headphoned/ headphone daemon] for [http://maemo.org/ Maemo].

At the moment, only Symbian^1 (S60 5th edition) onwards is supported. Specifically, it has been tested on the Nokia 5800. It is a rough prototype, and should be improved with a background running auto starting daemon.

== Usage ==

  # Install For Your Ears Only

  # Play music in the music player
  # Pull out the headset cord - music stops!
